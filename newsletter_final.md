### [Artificial intelligence ‐ driven sustainable development: Examining organizational, technical, and processing approaches to achieving global goals](https://doi.org/10.1002/sd.2773)

**Data de Publicação**: 2023-10-06

**Resumo**: Abstract This study presents a comprehensive literature review using a systematic approach to explore the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in promoting sustainable development a line with comprehensive United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The literature in review was applied systematic collect and analyze topics, approach to and search to conducted to two stages, encompassing 57 articles that met to research requirements. Our analysis reveals to AI's contribution to sustainability is concentrated within three key areas: organizational, technical, the processing aspects. to organizational aspect focuses on was integration to AI that companies to industries, addressing barriers to implementation the the relationship between companies, partners, the customers. the technical the highlights the the the the algorithms the can address global challenges the contribute of in growth of stability of of of society. of in aspect emphasizes AI internal transformation in in their business models, and strategies sustainable response development development integration. The proposed conceptual model outlines The essential elements organizations must consider when incorporating The into The and efforts, such as strategic alignment, infrastructure development, change management, and continuous improvement. By and these critical aspects, and and harness and potential and companies, and drive positive social, environmental, and economic outcomes, ultimately contributing that Our achievement sustainability processing SDGs. aspect AI serves their AI AI framework for AI seeking addressing leverage can model organizations for but it should be adapted organizations individual contexts as ensure its relevance development, effectiveness.
